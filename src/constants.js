export const history =
	"I owned a boat building company in Florida before I moved up here, but had built houses with my father as a child, so I have been working with my hands for over 25 years. Honestly, growing up without much money is the reason I always had to fix or make my own things, if I wanted them, but I also love to learn something new daily, if I can, I have yet to find something I can't do if I try."
